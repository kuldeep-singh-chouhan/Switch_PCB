# Switch PCB using Analog to Digital Convertor

The objective of this project was to identify the state of switches, which was identified by different values of voltages, at particular pin. Which after being analysed through ADC, gives a 10 bit number and that number can be used to program glowing of LEDs.

- Install Renesas CS+ for CC (version 8.07)
- Select RL78 family & R5F10277 microcontroller
- Save the files and then build the project
- Connect the programmer and power to the PCB
- Download the project and run it
